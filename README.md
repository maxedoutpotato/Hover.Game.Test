# Hover.Game.Test
Mini-game project made with gemini, arcade/racing

This is my first game project and it is coded with Gemini. For main reference and inspiration I use PlayStation 1 Wipeout series.
The project will have a unique dark, archam-like comic style visuals. With retro elements in architecture and vehicle appearance.
Project goals:
* Fast-pace racing with hovering magnet ships. Gameplay with weapon/shield/healing mechanics. 
* Intuitive steering and smooth gameplay, similar to early Wipeout series.
* Simulating real hover vehicle pilot experience with immersive cockpit view and dynamic 3rd person camera.
* Experiment with a few new mechanics in Arcade Racing Genre.
* Create challenging, yet player-friendly race tracks. Push boundries of dangerous, breathtaking and anti-gravity turns in track construction.
* Maintaining a comic/detective style visuals and effects.
* Create custom music tracks and make music interact with gameplay and visuals.

I make the 3D model pipeline from drawing concepts to animating and with the help of Gemini AI, I can create, bring to life and share my vision/work.
Im very excited as the progress of the project grows!
